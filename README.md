I am a user experience designer. I am working to expand my skillset to include a front-end development. I have a basic working knowledge of html and css, and I am currently deep diving into javascript. Over the next couple of months, my goal is to hard code my portfolio, case studies, and resume. I hope that my portfolio can beging to speak to my skills as a UX designer as well as front-end development.
